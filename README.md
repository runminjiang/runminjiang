- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @runminjiang
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computational Imaging within the realms of Terahertz, Medical, and Optical domains.
- ğŸ“« I have a strong desire to utilize artificial intelligence to transcend the limitations of traditional hardware, aiming to achieve super-resolution optimization in imaging, even under stringent conditions (Few- or One-shot; Weakly- or Semi-supervised).
